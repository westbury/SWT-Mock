/**
 * This package contains the mock implementations for the SWT controls.
 * <P>
 * <code>Control</code> and <code>Viewer</code> objects are mocked.  Supporting
 * classes that do not depend on <code>Control</code> objects are not mocked.  So,
 * for example, layout objects are not mocked, neither are label and content
 * providers.
